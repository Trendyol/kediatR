/**
 * A caching wrapper around the Registry interface that improves performance by caching resolved handlers.
 *
 * This implementation provides significant performance improvements by avoiding repeated handler resolution
 * for the same request/notification types. It uses thread-safe concurrent maps to ensure proper behavior
 * in multi-threaded environments.
 *
 * The caching strategy:
 * - Request handlers are cached by their exact class type
 * - Notification handlers are cached as collections by their class type
 * - Pipeline behaviors are cached as a single collection since they apply to all requests
 * - All caches use ConcurrentHashMap for thread safety without synchronization overhead
 *
 * Cache invalidation is not implemented as handlers are typically registered once during application
 * startup and remain constant throughout the application lifecycle.
 *
 * @param delegate The underlying registry implementation that performs the actual handler resolution
 * @see Registry
 * @see RegistryImpl
